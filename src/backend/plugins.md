# Location 
The plugins will be held in `PLUGIN_BASE_PATH` environment variable. Each plugin will have its own folder. 
Eg. For plugin named "elephant" it will be placed in `PLUGIN_BASE_PATH/elephant/main.py`.

# Requirements
If a python requires any extra packages it needs to be written in its `requirements.txt` file in the same folder as the plugins main python script.
